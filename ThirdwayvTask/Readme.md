architecture: 
VIPER Architecture

design patterns:
Singleton

why: 

- More abstraction and therefore more scalability options in the future.
- A tighter architecture that is more reliable and less prone to error.
- Although the initial stages of development can be slow, after understanding the flow itâ€™s as easy and fast as implementing any other architecture.
- Easier for developers to understand where is what because of the single responsibility principle.
